# Surfs_Up Weather Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to provide W.Avy insight into the weather patterns in Oahu. He wants the temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. 
 
## Resources 

* Data File: `hawaii.sqlite`
* Software:  Python 3.7, Visual Studio Code 1.50.0, Anaconda 4.8.5, Jupyter Notebook 6.1.4, Pandas, Numpy, Sqlalchemy.

Based on  the two tables above I was able to gather the key differences as following:
- The weather does not change much from June to December.
- The avg temparture in June is 75 and Dec is 71 degrees. Which is only a 4 degrees difference. 
- The max temparture in June is 85 and Dec is 83 degrees. I think the traffic would be the same due to the tempature.
- Temperature in Oahu in June and December does not reach over 85Â°F.  
- The minimum temparture may be the deciding factor which is 64 in June and  56 in Dec,which is not that unbearable situation. 

## Summary

-Looking at the completed analysis I think it would be a great idea to open up a surf shop in Oahu. Realizing the traffic may be a little lower in December due to the 
lower tempatures W.Avy may want to figure out a way to supplement income during that month.

-Tourism in Hawaii is very important and the businesses really depends on it .According to state government data, there were over 9.4 million visitors to the Hawaiian
 Islands with expenditures of over $16 billion in 2017 alone.

-Based on the anaylsis above, the weather does not change significantly from June to Decemeber.

-Following two additional queries are helpful to see how much rain they get in June and in Decemember:

It is clear that Oahu, Hawaii in December is colder and rains more than in June and, therefore, one could expect a little slow month, or people may not spend their time 
outside and decide to spend more time in store getting ice cream or shopping. 
However, the data is showing that the differences (whether the temperature or the amount of rain) between June and December are not huge, which makes this business 
proposal more appealing.
